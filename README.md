# USSD menu star

This app enables USSD menus to be created in [Avo admin](https://avohq.io/) and for these menus to be served via a callback API. The callback API is designed to work with [Africa's Talking](https://africastalking.com/ussd) [USSD callback API](https://developers.africastalking.com/docs/ussd/handle_sessions) but should be easily updatable to work with other providers.

Input can be requested from your USSD users and persisted as JSON and this data can then be downloaded as a CSV file.

## Local development

### Install Ruby

1. Install a ruby version manager e.g. [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)

2. Install the ruby version specified in `.ruby-version`, for instance

```bash
$ rbenv install 3.4.2
```

### Setup and Run Postgres

Assuming a MacOS or linux OS:
```bash
$ brew install postgresql
$ brew services start postgresql
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
$ bundle install
```

### Start using your local dev environment

You can now set up your local DBs:

```bash
$ bin/rails db:create
$ bin/rails db:create RAILS_ENV=test
$ bin/rails db:migrate
```

Create [users](test/fixtures/user.yml) for sign in
```bash
bin/rails db:fixtures:load
```

Run the local server with:

```bash
  bin/rails s
```

The app should now be available at http://localhost:3000

Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to view and navigate the app in Africa's Talking [simulator](https://developers.africastalking.com/simulator). To use the simulator you first need to setup a USSD app in Africa's Talking sandbox environment and set the callback API URL.

## ðŸ’¯ Tests

To run tests run rspec:

```bash
$ bin/rspec
```

To run system tests with a visible Chrome browser run:

```bash
  HEADLESS=false bin/rspec
```

Tests are run [automatically](.github/workflows/ci.yml) when code is pushed to GitHub.

## Production

To run the app in production a rails cache provider is required, something like [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis-rb?tab=readme-ov-file#redis-rb--) or [Solid Cache](https://github.com/rails/solid_cache?tab=readme-ov-file#solid-cache).
